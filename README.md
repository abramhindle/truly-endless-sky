# Truly Endless Sky
 
Truly Endless Sky, helpers to aide in procedural generation of game content for the game "Endless Sky".

# Motivation

I wanted to make endless sky a procedural game without changing the game engine itself. The challenge was manipulating the strange data format they use where they rely on tab based hierarchical trees.
